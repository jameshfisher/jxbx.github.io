            <h2><i>Domestic Imaginaries</i> and <i>Post Production</i></h2>
            <p>
I was tasked with producing banner graphics the film studies department at Queen Mary, University of London. <i>Domestic Imaginaries</i> is a study group focused on representations of the home in British cinema; I created an image of a typical 1940s living room and filled it with oridinary yet meaningful objects which could tell a story about their owners and the era they lived in.
<br><br>
<i>Post Production</i> is a wide-ranging portal for postgraduate film studies; for this I created a summative image of the filmmaking process and constructed it in a way which would suggest energy and movement across the spread of a long, narrow frame.
